AUTHORS:        Brigham Aldrich
DESCRIPTION:    Bezier Curve Playground
DEPENDENCIES:   Python 3.XX, PyGame 2.6.1

INFO:           This program lets you create and manipulate bezier curves.
                Simply click anywhere to add points in order.
                Click and drag on points or their "handles" in order to manipulate their positions and slopes.
                Bezier curves use cubic spline interpolation to map the 0th, 1st, and 2nd derivatives on both sides of each point.
